About me:

<div id = "aboutme">

<p> My name is Garrett Harmon. I am a senior majoring in Computer Information Systems. I'm not sure what I want to do with this degree, but I am excited to see where it takes me. Right now I'm just enjoying talking to recruiters at Career Fairs on campus and getting my name out there. </p>
<p>I am from a small town outside of Auburn, AL called Lanett. During High School, I did Theater for four years and won several awards for acting during my time. I actually met my current girlfriend at a state competition my senior year, we've been together for nearly four years now. Oh yeah, and I played a whole season of Golf my junior year just so I could say I played a sport in high school. After High School, I attended Troy University for a year (2015-2016) before I decided that I liked UNA better and transferred here. I am excited to graduate May 2019! </p>
<p> Once I made it to UNA, I pledged Alpha Tau Omega and have been infatuated with Greek Life ever since. See, in American culture, Greek Life is sort of romanticized in a way that people like to view it as the most fun you'll ever have; the peak of your Undergraduate career if you will. I love the hilariously over-exaggerated movies, the frat stereotypes, and just the general atmosphere of what people like to make it. However, real Greek Life is misrepresented by the comedy movies, satires, and other media. Greek Life in the real world teaches values, accountability, leadership and so much more. I have met several other devoted brothers from all over the U.S through the amazing opportunities that have been provided for me. </p>
<p> I currently work at Billy Reid Corporate here in Florence as a help desk technician and have worked there for a year now. I work on computers every day there and I love it. Most of my day consists of troubleshooting and problem solving different technical/information systems and I have learned so much from it. I am thankful for finally landing a job that relates to my major and jump-starts my career because I have worked other unrelated jobs up until this point in my college run. I was a waiter/dishwasher for two different country buffet restaurants, sold fireworks in a warehouse as a seasonal employee for 6 different terms(Very fun job by the way. You'd be surprised at how much some people spend on fireworks), and have DJ'd at various parties and reunions.(I use Pioneer hardware and Serato software.) </p>
<p> That's quite possibly everything you could ever want to know about me! I'm excited for my senior year here at UNA, and while the anticipation of graduating is slowly advancing my stage 4 senioritus, I am more than happy to take a breath and just enjoy the last year of my undergrad. </p>
-Garrett
